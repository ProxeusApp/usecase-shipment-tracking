# usecase-shipment-tracking

This repository contains Raspbeery source code used in the logistic tracking prototype described
in the [Supply-chain tracking](https://www.proxeus.com/blog-posts/proxeus-technology-enables-shipment-tracking-system-based-on-iota) use case.

The code is separated in two parts:
1. the UI located in the `rfid-ui` directory and
2. the server which is responsible to control the RFID reader hardware and create transactions on the IOTA blockchain.

The code is provided as a starting point for further experiments.
